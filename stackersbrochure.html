        <div class="text">
            <h3>Fully Automated Parking Systems</h3>
            <p>Our flagship automated systems use smart sensors, lift modules, and rotating pallets to park and retrieve cars without
            human assistance. Drivers simply leave their vehicle at the entry bay, and our intelligent system handles the rest.</p>
            <p>This technology drastically reduces waiting time and eliminates the need for ramps or driveways. It’s ideal for commercial
            towers, malls, and urban spaces where every square foot counts.</p>

            <h3>Hydraulic Car Parking Solutions</h3>
            <p>Hydraulic systems provide simple yet powerful lifting technology that can be deployed in residential or industrial settings.
            The lifts operate with stable hydraulic pressure, delivering smooth motion and lasting reliability.</p>
            <p>Each unit is designed to minimize energy consumption and noise, while offering high load-bearing capacity. Maintenance
            intervals are low, and the system integrates effortlessly with both single and double-level configurations.</p>
            <p>Our hydraulic modules are manufactured with reinforced steel structures and precision seals to ensure long-term durability
            even under frequent usage cycles.</p>

            <h3>Stacker Parking Systems</h3>
            <p>Stacker parking is a proven, mechanical approach to double or triple your available parking slots without expanding

            and can be relocated or expanded as your parking demand grows.</p>

            <h3>Puzzle Parking Technology</h3>
            <p>Puzzle parking operates like a three-dimensional grid where platforms move vertically and horizontally to access the
            desired car. It maximizes capacity while providing individual vehicle independence.</p>
            <p>Our puzzle solutions come with advanced motion control units, real-time sensors, and an intuitive HMI interface for
            seamless operation. They are designed to fit both basements and above-ground structures.</p>
            <p>Each module is factory-tested for synchronization accuracy and safety compliance to international mechanical standards.</p>

            <h3>Tower Parking Systems</h3>
            <p>Tower parking systems are vertical marvels that utilize limited ground area for high-volume storage. Cars are moved
            vertically by an elevator system to their assigned bay.</p>

            The structure supports multi-level automation and smart access control for authorized users only.</p>
            <p>Trivanta Edge tower systems are engineered for stability, aesthetic integration, and long service life with minimal maintenance.</p>

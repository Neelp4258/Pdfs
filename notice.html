                <li style="margin: 10px 0;">Upon investigation and review of CCTV footage, we discovered that <strong>Raushan Singh</strong>, a labour employed by contractor Dharma Nirmal, was captured on camera stealing our materials on <strong>September 22, 2025, between 8:30 PM to 9:00 PM</strong>.</li>

                <li style="margin: 10px 0;">It was revealed that Raushan Singh had been hiding the stolen materials in his labour camp located within the project premises.</li>
                <li style="margin: 10px 0;">The stolen materials were subsequently sold to <strong>Khalid Ahmed</strong>, a scrap dealer (Bhangar Wala), whose establishment is located approximately 200 meters from the project site.</li>

            As per the terms of engagement and standard industry practices, the builder/project head bears the responsibility for security and safety of all contractors, sub-contractors, and their employees working on the project premises. The contractor Dharma Nirmal was engaged by you for civil services, and their employee's criminal activities have resulted in substantial financial losses to our organization.

        <div class="content">
            Despite the presence of security measures and previous warnings, the theft continued unabated, indicating a systemic failure in site management and supervision. The fact that stolen materials were being stored in the labour camp within the project premises itself demonstrates gross negligence in security protocols.
